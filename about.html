                            Born and raised in Virginia, Muhammad—also known as Raheem Darab—grew up in a quiet neighborhood called The Villa. Raised by immigrant parents with strict rules, his world was small. With limited freedom, creativity became the outlet. Alongside his brother Naeem and best friend Chase, Muhammad spent his early years making comedy—turning everyday moments into stories with a camera and imagination.

                        <p class="has-text-indent">
                            In 2017, everything shifted. Naeem, shared a vision: he wanted to create his own TV show. What started as an idea turned into years of relentless creation. For five straight years, the brothers filmed nonstop, learning, failing, and refining their craft.

                        <p class="has-text-indent">
                            The breakthrough came when Naeem realized their storytelling could extend beyond skits—into real stories. They turned their lens toward high school basketball, beginning with a documentary series titled <i>Run It Back: Hayfield Basketball</i>, at Hayfield Secondary School in Alexandria, Virginia.

                        <p class="has-text-indent">
                            The following year, they returned with a second full-length <i>Run It Back</i> series—this time at Jackson-Reed High School in Washington, DC—cementing their presence in the DMV basketball space.

                        <p class="has-text-indent">
                            Since then, De La Villa has established a signature docu-style rooted in authenticity and culture. Today, they are working with Team Durant and expanding their vision beyond the DMV—bringing their storytelling to a national stage.
